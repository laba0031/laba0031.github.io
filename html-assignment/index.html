        <h2>About Me</h2>
    </article>
        <p>My name is <strong>Mikayla</strong>. My initals are <abbr title="Mikayla Evelyn Labadie">MEL</abbr>. I'm from Keswick, a small town north of Toronto. I'm a <mark>surrealist conceptual</mark> photographer. Most of my body of work is self portraits but I'm starting to branch out to doing portraits of other people as well. I've started making a bucket list and right at the top is to do a photo shoot with <em>Lady Gaga</em>.</p>
       
        <p>Today is currently September 27<sup>th</sup> 2021. I am studying <em>Interactive Media Design</em>, at <strong>Algonquin College</strong> in <em>Ottawa</em>. Using the skills provided from this program, I hope to be able to work for myself one day. Not sure what I want to do yet, hopefully stay a <strong>photographer</strong> but would love to be able to add more skills to my <em>resume</em>. </p>
