        <p>My name is <strong>Mikayla</strong>. I'm from Keswick, a small town north of Toronto. I'm a <mark>surrealist conceptual</mark> photographer. Most of my body of work is self portraits but I'm starting to branch out to doing portraits of other people as well. I've started making a bucket list and right at the top is to do a photo shoot with <em>Lady Gaga</em>.</p>
